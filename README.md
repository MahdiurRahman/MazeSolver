# The Maze Solver

Hey,

This project takes in a maze in the form of a text file
and finds a solution for the maze by making use of the 
'stack' data-structure.

It displays my understanding of:
  1. The Stack data structure and how it can be used
  2. OOP
  3. fstream and file reading
  4. writing complex functions
